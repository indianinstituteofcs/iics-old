               | How do I educate my daughters about computing?
            p.lead
                | We all want our kids to learn Computer Sciencefor it leads to money and fame.  But most people don't understand what it is.

            p.lead
                | I firmly believe that some level of Computing should be necessary to graduate, taught much earlier in schools, and be represented in the culture of education just as literature, science, languages, math and science are.
            
            p.lead
                | I designed a series of mini courses with my daughters since they were 7-8 years old to help them understand computing.  As of now (2020) the older one is college and younger one is in 8th grade.  This course benefits from what I learned along the way, and I hope it will benefit other kids and families and dispel the many misconceptions about computing.

                      | There is a typical token teacher (at most two) who teach how to build websites and write basic programs.

                                span In my experience the answer is yes and no. <br> Yes - because it is cool to say that one is learning Computing. <br>No â€“ because it gets difficult, math heavy and real programming sucks away time from friends.

                                span It is amazing to how many people computing is nothing more than programming. And furthermore, programming is nothing more building a website.

                                span Is like saying that the whole of writing is nothing more than writing tweets.
